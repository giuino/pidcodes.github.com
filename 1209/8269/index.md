This is an open source Hotas (Hands On Throttle-And-Stick) for RSI StarCitizen aficionados
The 3d modeled parts reproduce a fully functional Throttle lever from a Drake Cutlass, coupled with some functional tweaks
An Arduino Micro controls everything and interfaces with PC as and HID interface.
Source code will be uploaded once everything is tested and working.
